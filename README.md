# IRON STORAGE 
A digital platform for renting and hosting storage spaces. This can be a basement, a room, a garage, a storeroom, or a car space. Our platform is an alternative to self-storage-facilities where you can host your own storage and earn money or rent good and secure storage in your neighborhood.

## Purpose
* Find a private storage space close by and store your belongings there. On average, private storage spaces are 50% cheaper than self-storage facilities and you can decide on the ideal location for your needs. Just enter your preferred location, an area or a zip code, and will take care of the rest
* Earn an additional income per month by renting out your unused spaces. Use vacant spaces like a half-empty basement, a garage or a storage room and offer them for rent. For your privacy and to stay protected, your name and your full address will only become visible once a booking has been confirmed. Your safety is our top priority.
